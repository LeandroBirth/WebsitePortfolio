                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Endemic  diseases  common  in  tropical  and  subtropical  countries  such  as  dengue,  yellow  fever,  Zika  and Chikugunya  are  reported  daily  in  the  media.  The  site  of  the  Brazilian  Ministry  of  Health  warned  about  the 264.1% increase in dengue cases in the country, from 62,900 in the first 11 weeks of 2018 to 229,064 in the same period  of  2019,  until  March  16,  2019  The  Zika  and  Chikungunya  numbers  were  registered,  2,062  and  12,942, respectively in the same dates. The project presents an analysis of the use of radiation as a form of sterilization of male Aedesaegyptimosquitoes.  An experiment  was  planned  to  observe  mosquito  population  growth  and  collect data. A Binomial regression model was used to verify the difference in two levels of radiation in the sterilization of  males. The  dose  of  30  Gy  has  decreased  approximately  50%  the  number  of  births  when  compared  to  25 Gy. The  irradiated  males  have  a  chance  of  competing  with  natural  males,  through  the  copula  of  the  females. However,  the  population  of  sterilized  males  must  be  at  least  six  times  greater  than  the  population of  natural males because it can provide a significant reduction in the number of larvae births.
