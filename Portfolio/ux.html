            <p>
                The Megaphone app is designed to empower political organizers and concerned citizens by serving as a centralized hub for discovering and managing political demonstrations in cities. Built for social good, this mobile app bridges the gap between event organizers and attendees by enabling real-time updates on events, including safety alerts, cancellations, and logistics, with features aimed at streamlining communication and organizing large-scale demonstrations.
